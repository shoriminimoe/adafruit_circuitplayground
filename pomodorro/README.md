# Pomodorro Timer

Make your Adafruit CircuitPlayground a repeating pomodorro timer. The LEDs
indicate the time left by dimming and turning off as the timer expires. The
LEDs are red, While the focus timer is active, and green while the break timer
is active. An alarm sounds when the timer expires.

## Usage

The only interaction required is to push button A to start the timer and stop
the alarm.
